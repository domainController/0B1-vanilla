        <h1>Resolutio Contractus™ Safeguards</h1>
        <section id="safeguard-intro">
          <p>
            The following clauses (A.1 to A.11) act as strategic safeguards
            protecting the integrity, readability, and sovereign nature of the
            <em>Resolutio Contractus</em>. They were not designed to escalate
            conflict, but to ensure ethical containment, irreversible framing,
            and operational clarity in the event of power asymmetry, silence, or
            narrative deviation.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="safeguard-clauses">
          <p>
            <strong>A.1 – Strategic Clarity Lock</strong><br />
            This clause guarantees that all parties acknowledge the strategic
            framework as a sovereign proposal—not as an emotional or retaliatory
            act. The posture is one of clarity, not vendetta.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>A.2 – No Exploitation Guarantee</strong><br />
            The tools presented are never to be used to extort, coerce, or
            generate artificial silence. The intent is diagnostic and
            architectural, not destructive.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>A.3 – Ethical Trigger Doctrine</strong><br />
            Every structural response (public exposure, propagation, or legal
            escalation) is pre-calibrated based on observed inertia or refusal.
            This doctrine is disclosed to avoid misunderstandings.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>A.4 – Narrative Restraint Covenant</strong><br />
            No counter-party will be publicly humiliated or named unless a clear
            structural threat to the ecosystem remains. Silence and discretion
            are preserved where resolution is genuine.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>A.5 – Sovereign Gatekeeping Clause</strong><br />
            The author retains the right to filter all contacts, requests, or
            negotiations through a protocolized gatekeeping interface.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>A.6 – Ethical Exit Scenario Provision</strong><br />
            Any actor may choose to co-finance a clean resolution framework—at
            cost—rather than face a full deployment of immersion or exposure
            mechanisms.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>A.7 – Propagation Delay Option</strong><br />
            Parties may request a structured delay in dissemination, provided
            this delay serves to implement internal corrective mechanisms with
            measurable outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>A.8 – Trace Immunity Clause</strong><br />
            No participant will be judged retroactively for having taken part in
            a framework instance—as long as they did not obstruct or sabotage
            its function.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>A.9 – Sovereign Coherence Pledge</strong><br />
            All frameworks produced under this contract maintain internal
            logical coherence and do not contain contradictory objectives. This
            clause protects collaborators and future users.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>A.10 – Reverse Sovereignty Trigger</strong><br />
            Any attack on the author’s integrity (narrative distortion, legal
            overreach, digital repression) will automatically trigger full
            public disclosure of the framework’s evolution and ethical basis.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>A.11 – Immutable Ownership Marker</strong><br />
            The framework and its derivatives are copyrighted by the author. Any
            reuse, integration, or replication without explicit licensing is
            prohibited and will trigger re-sovereignization measures.

          <h2>
            Ethical Clauses – Structural Safeguards for External Oversight
          </h2>
          <p>
            These clauses are intended to preserve systemic integrity and
            reassure senior profiles with a background in economic crime
            prevention. They ensure the framework operates within verifiable
            boundaries, with traceable intentions and reversible exits under
            specific conditions.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Clause of Delimited Narratives</strong><br />
              The framework shall not be used to pursue extended speculative
              narratives beyond the scope of the host asset.<br />
              All hypotheses must be documented in the
              <em>Self-Audit Capsule™</em> with internal evidentiary thresholds.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Clause of Contained Escalation</strong><br />
              Public releases are permitted only after three internal ethical
              reviews, including a dedicated checkpoint led by the Oversight
              Figure (e.g., ex-Ekobrotts profile).<br />
              The figure may suspend publication by issuing a formal
              <em>ethical freeze note</em> (EFN).
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Clause of Strategic Non-Retaliation</strong><br />
              No private individual or non-institutional figure shall be
              targeted or exposed without systemic impact validation.<br />
              The framework excludes any use that would qualify as personal
              vengeance, public humiliation, or character destruction.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Clause of Signal Containment</strong><br />
              Signals collected beyond the initial perimeter must be classified
              in a non-propagating tier unless unlocked through structured
              consent from all sovereign co-operators.<br />
              This clause guarantees vertical respect of role boundaries
              (dishwasher to VP to GP).
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Clause of Audit-First Deployment</strong><br />
              Any Silent Immersion or propagation scenario must begin with an
              internal audit phase.<br />
              The embedded profile (observer) must co-sign a zero-retaliation
              agreement and log all interactions through a secured Ethical
              Watchpoint Protocol™.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These clauses are designed to enable the participation of
            high-integrity profiles, notably former investigators, without
            compromising the disruptive potential of the Post-Litigious
            Framework.
