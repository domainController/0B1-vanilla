            This term sheet will be automatically activated if the board’s
            ultimatum strategy results in the forwarding of a truncated version

          <!-- ⚙️ PARAGRAPHE 1 : DÉFINITION SYNTHÉTIQUE DU SCÉNARIO -->
          <p>
            This alternative scenario is designed for
            <strong>CEO- or GP-led transformations</strong>, targeting toxic or
            opaque assets within a complex portfolio. Rather than operate as a
            classic consultant, I embed myself as an
            <strong>integrity cell under pseudo-narrative cover</strong>. My
            presence is <em>ambiguous by design</em>, tailored to generate
            self-correction dynamics without triggering resistance or internal
            panic.
          </p>

          <!-- 🧭 PARAGRAPHE 2 : DESCRIPTION TECHNIQUE DU MÉCANISME -->
          <p>
            The scenario is a <strong>one-shot</strong>, launched from a
            pre-identified point of altitude — typically a strategic node with
            symbolic or managerial authority (C-level, board relay, proxy role).
            The deployment relies on <strong>slow behavioral immersion</strong>,
            under partial dissimulation (or pseudonymy), and can adapt to the
            topology of the site. It's not about numbers — it's about how
            <em>the internal power map is drawn</em>. Assets are touched not by
            will, but by gravity.
          </p>

          <!-- 📡 PARAGRAPHE 3 : LOGIQUE DE PROPAGATION & SPREAD -->
          <p>
            Once in place, the cell initiates a
            <strong>calibrated ethical spread</strong>. In some configurations,
            the impact stays local (3 to 7 interconnected nodes). But when the
            ecosystem is cohesive — family-owned, symbolically driven, or
            socially tense — the spread may reach
            <strong>20, 30, even 40 assets</strong>. Each touched node becomes a
            <em>latent mirror</em> for the others. The more time I remain
            embedded, the more the architecture internalizes the presence and
            amplifies the reach.
          </p>

          <!-- 🔥 PARAGRAPHE 4 : FACTEURS DE DÉCLENCHEMENT ET D’ADHÉSION -->
          <p>
            The spread isn’t viral — it’s <strong>aspirational</strong>. It
            works best where dysfunction is high, where people are frustrated,
            and where
            <em>the figure I embody offers a form of structural hope</em>. But
            more than moral stature, it is the
            <strong>possibility of becoming</strong> that drives the ripple.
            Staff don’t just admire — they <em>project themselves</em>. They
            imagine their own trajectory shifting. If they mimic the posture, if
            they absorb the codes, they too might rise — ethically,
            symbolically, or even financially. That mimetic pull creates
            <strong>long-range alignment</strong>.
          </p>

          <!-- 🧪 PARAGRAPHE 5 : NOTE OPÉRATIONNELLE FINALE -->
          <p>
            The scenario can be deployed on
            <strong>1 to 5 assets by default</strong>, with optional extension
            across an entire portfolio. The decision to scale depends on
            preliminary terrain analysis — studying hierarchy depth, relational
            mesh, exposure levels, and symbolic channels.
            <em>It is not a plug-and-play tactic</em>: it requires understanding
            how management thinks, how frustration travels, and where people
            secretly look for answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The setup assumes a 4-month immersion will be conducted without
            prior announcement, within a single asset designated by the owner.
            No agenda disclosed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Signals emerging outside the operational site — through
            <strong>unsolicited feedback</strong> or
            <strong>indirect relays</strong> — will feed a 4-month report, which
            will take the form of an audit via
            <strong>symbolic accorporation</strong>.

                This role is structured as a
                <strong>silent strategic cartographer</strong> — a
                signal-bearing agent embedded within the ecosystem to surface
                buried frictions, restore symbolic coherence, and reinforce the

                  <strong>No personal deal-making:</strong> the agent cannot

                  <strong>Trusted connector:</strong> allowed to initiate

                  <strong>Risk-oriented logic:</strong> the primary output is

                In interpersonal conflict, the default posture remains
                <em>flight</em> or <em>restraint</em>. If retaliation is
                necessary, it must be followed by a visible
                <em>gesture of renewal</em>. Nobility is not optional. It is
                already treated as a structural constraint, and will be formally
                encoded in any forthcoming license or deployment contract.

            This manifesto compiles the core principles I adhere to. Each

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>I. Loyalty</strong> — Loyalty is not a flag to wave — it is
            a silent form of active fidelity, even under strain.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>II. Strategic Silence</strong> — Strategic silence is a
            resource. I observe more than I speak. What I withhold builds
            authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>III. Work Ethic</strong> — Work is a commitment, not a
            margin of negotiation. Seven days a week if needed.

          <p>
            <strong>IV. Comfort</strong> — Personal comfort is never the

          <p>
            <strong>V. Autonomy</strong> — If I sleep in the office, it's
            discipline, not dysfunction. I’ve made autonomy a form of hygiene.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>VI. Rules & Integrity</strong> — I don’t wait for the rules
            to be explained. I read them. I follow them — unless they betray the
            collective.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>VII. Recognition</strong> — I seek no recognition or
            promotion. I seek the integrity of the role.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>VIII. Presence</strong> — My presence creates calm, not
            noise. If that fails, I withdraw.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>IX. Injustice</strong> — I see every injustice not as
            offense but as calibration. If I respond, it will be by clarity, not
            emotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>X. Legacy</strong> — What I build must be transferable. If I

            The mission is conducted on-site within a defined operational
            perimeter, under a framework aligned with strategic oversight and
            stakeholder coordination. It is designed to enable
            <strong>legitimate access</strong> to local workflows and decision
            environments — without disrupting existing hierarchies.

          <p>
            At month 7, a strategic exposure draft will be issued to Elite for
            orientation and internal alignment. A full version including
            indirect signals may be retained, pending internal discussion on
            governance-level sharing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The posture is <strong>coordinated, not directive</strong>.
            Observations and field presence are conducted with restraint,
            minimal frequency, and full transparency. The role acts as a
            <em>symbolic relay</em> and <em>field coherence indicator</em>, not
            as an implementer or process owner.

            This role initiates a <strong>low-noise resonance track</strong>,

            not to hold power, but to align tensions, surface unspoken risk
            patterns, and channel internal coherence without triggering
            structural defense. The mission is unannounced, confidential, and

              Requires a <strong>dedicated flat, 15–25 m²</strong>, adapted to
              an intense 7-day rhythm. If based in <u>Stockholm</u>, it should

              I work <strong>seven days a week</strong>. I require
              <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
                >minimal friction, full discretion, and uninterrupted
                focus</mark
              >. That means: no service interference, no noise, and no corridor
              exposure.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Full focus requires solitude.</strong> I operate best when

              bandwidth.

              This housing is not a perk. It’s a structural prerequisite — a
              functional basecamp to support the unique tempo, ethical
              restraint, and downstream clarity required by the role.

            This mission may be revoked at any time by Elite Hotels — without

          <h3>🔁 Strategic Resonance Layer</h3>

          <p>
            A subset of long-term effects has been observed across similar
            scenarios, typically unplanned but recurrent. These include low-key
            morale drift, reverse mentorship phenomena, and visible value
            realignment in mid-layer teams. While these are not intended, they
            are structurally embedded due to transparency and traceability
            features.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this mission is formally scoped for 12 months, its impact is
            designed to extend beyond direct execution. Presence on site
            triggers a cascade of secondary effects:
            <strong
              >internal audit reflexes, symbolic alignment gestures, moral
              reanchoring</strong
            >, and <u>peer-driven standardization</u>. These effects are seeded
            structurally, not taught.
          </p>

          <p>
            The consultant retains the option to
            <strong>exit every 3 months</strong> without justification, unless
            otherwise engaged in a parallel deployment.

              >David Haldane remains sovereign on all directional
              decisions</mark
            >
            (see Annex IV – Prerogative Clause), including early termination,
            scope freezing, or full replication ban.

          <p>
            No permanent leadership title is required. However,
            <u>temporary C-suite exposure may be requested</u> (e.g. boardroom
            access, memo validation, discreet strategic attendance) to
            <strong>maximize signal transfer and reduce friction</strong>
            between operational sensing and executive coordination.

          Upon mission completion:

          <u>company renamed</u> to reflect independent activity,

            Out of respect for internal dynamics, the version circulated among
