        <h2>🔍 Trigger & Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Trigger event:</strong> The governance crisis erupted after an
          altercation between <a href="#" class="internal-link">Sahar</a> and an
          employee, under <a href="#" class="internal-link">Henrik Siebert</a>'s
          passive watch. The incident revealed the absence of strategic
          guardrails and a deeply informal management structure.
        </p>
<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
<p>
Henrik failed by inertia, Sahar by aggression. <u>No visible communication between the two leads</u>. 
<strong>Responsibilities were avoided on both sides</strong>. Parallel tracks,  weak stress management. <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">The collapse stemmed from a lack of initial and strategic alignment</mark>.
</p>
        <section>
          <h2>Design Flaw</h2>
          <p>
            Putting two people at the top of a new venture means forming a
            <strong>co-founding team</strong>.
            <strong>Investors never fund ideas</strong> — they fund teams. A
            real team means
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">shared values</mark>,
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">shared history</mark>, and
            the ability to <strong>handle tension without breaking</strong>.
          </p>
        </section>

<h2>The Miscast</h2>
<p>
The actual <strong>design flaw</strong> wasn’t Sahar’s behavior — it was <strong>Sahail’s absence from operations</strong>. 
He had the history, the adversity, the shared scars with Henrik. <u>He should have been in the room</u>. </p>

<p>
Instead, Sahar — <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">a first-time operator with poor stress resilience</mark> — was left to absorb daily tension she wasn’t trained for. 
The core failure wasn’t intent, but a <strong>misplaced delegation of roles</strong>.
</p>
        </section>

        <section>


<h2>Founder's Job Misunderstood</h2>
<p>
One of the founder’s role is to <strong>handle the hardest problems</strong>. Same with tensions. It’s your job to <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">tackle uncomfortable issues</mark> and <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">initiate difficult conversations</mark>. If you avoid those, <strong>you’re not doing your part</strong>.
</p>
        </section>

<h2>What Could Have Saved It</h2>
<p>
In a proven business model like restaurants, you can offset weak chemistry — 
<strong>but only if you write everything down</strong>. <u>Mission, vision, values, roles, culture</u> 
— all must be explicit. Then you talk. <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">
  You sit down before, and you keep talking throughout</mark>.
</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2><mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">📊 Final Note</mark></h2>
          <p>
            <strong>This wasn’t a failure of intention</strong>. It was a
            <strong>failure of design</strong>.
            <u>The structure wasn’t built for tension</u>. And when pressure
            came, it broke where no foundation had ever been laid.

        <h2>🔍 Preliminary Forecast: Likely Moves</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ❌ <strong>Remove visible crisis agents</strong> — Sahar and Henrik
            Siebert
          </li>
          <li>
            ⚡ <strong>Freeze silent shareholders</strong> — Daniella Dahl,
            others
          </li>
          <li>
            📊 <strong>Restructure equity map internally</strong> — ensure
            clarity, risk symmetry
          </li>
          <li>
            💼 <strong>Assign Saahil a co-directorship role</strong> — loyal,
            low-profile figure
          </li>
          <li>
            🍳 <strong>Hand operational control to Henrik Kling</strong> —
            continuity with culinary credibility
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
<section>

  <h2>🧭 Structured Departure Pathways</h2>
  <p>
    A transition scenario is currently under review by the hotel board. It aims to allow <strong>Henrik Kling</strong> to exit his executive role without reputational damage while preserving the restaurant’s operational momentum. The hotel considers this option viable if the Chef <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">publicly supports the continuity</mark> of the concept and remains available for consultation post-exit.
  </p>

  <h2>💸 Partial Buy-Out with Time-Limited Collaboration</h2>
  <p>
    A mid-scenario involves Elite Hotels initiating a <u>partial acquisition of HSSC Event AB</u>, offering Sahil and Henrik a premium buyout conditioned on their continued involvement for a defined period (e.g., 6–12 months). This would ensure a <strong>stable handover</strong> and maintain culinary excellence during transition. The proposal would be discreetly framed as a strategic reallocation of operational focus.
  </p>

  <h2>⚠️ Clean Break under Financial Duress</h2>
  <p>
    If no amicable solution emerges, the hotel may initiate a clean operational severance citing <strong>financial misalignment, lack of transparency, or reputational risk</strong>. This scenario implies high legal scrutiny and a potential freeze of current contracts. However, it exposes Elite Hotel to <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">counterclaims</mark> unless strong documentation is gathered in advance.
  </p>

  <h2>🛡️ Legal Containment & Risk Framing</h2>
  <p>
    In all cases, the strategy revolves around building a <strong>paper trail of legitimate concern</strong>: absence of long-term strategic vision, <u>excessive financial extraction</u>, or dissonance in values. This narrative is crucial for internal justification and legal preparedness. Such a positioning also allows the group to <strong>maintain control over PR</strong> while offering stakeholders a plausible explanation.
  </p>

      <section>
        <h2>👁 Hidden Risk Factors</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ❌ Henrik: <em>reputation-damaging history</em>, visible scandal
            factor
          </li>
          <li>
            ⚡ Sahar: <em>conflict-prone, poor crisis handling</em>, no longer
            credible with staff
          </li>
          <li>
            ☑ Saahil: <em>low public exposure, holds symbolic legitimacy</em>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>🔎 Strategic Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          Eliminate dual opacity (Henrik + Sahar). Transfer all day-to-day roles
          to <strong>qualified third-party operators</strong> with domain
          expertise (Asian cuisine, hospitality ops).
        </p>
        <p>
          Require <strong>in-person commitment from Saahil</strong> in any
          future governance role. No more passive proxy.
        </p>

  <h2>🧭 Henrik Siebert – Strategic Exit Guidance</h2>

  <p><strong>After five years of leadership, Henrik has turned the site into a <u>benchmark for high-end dining in Malmö</u>.</strong>
  <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">Revenue reached 41.1 MSEK in 2023</mark> with an <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">after-tax profit of 5.29 MSEK</mark>.
  The restaurant holds a <u>three-week waiting list</u> and has become a <strong>cash engine</strong> and reputational pillar for the hotel group.</p>

  <p><strong>But Henrik's late-stage posture reveals a growing <u>value misalignment</u> with the group.</strong>
  His role shifted toward <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">financial extraction</mark> over long-term strategic alignment.
  This logic also shaped the operational structure — including <u>incoherent role assignments</u> and <strong>unstable management pairings</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>We recommend a clean, honorable exit</strong>, built on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>✅ Recognition</strong>: Acknowledge Henrik as the <em>founder and architect</em> of the premium model.</li>
    <li><strong>📤 Transition</strong>: Plan a short-term disengagement with clear handovers and limited visibility.</li>
    <li><strong>💸 Buyout</strong>: Propose a controlled financial settlement to avoid long-tail disruption or claims.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>This ensures:</strong> no public scandal, no internal fracture, and a narrative of <u>strategic maturity</u>, not expulsion.
  It preserves investor confidence and <a href="#" class="subtle-link">reinforces the hotel’s premium integrity</a>.</p>
