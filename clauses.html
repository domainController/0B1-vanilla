                  A lightweight integrity mechanism based on local commits and
                  hash-based versioning. Ideal for progressive traceability in
                  early-stage or internal exchanges.

                  A timestamping and verification protocol anchored in

                  legal-grade undeniability, and public trace exposure.

            <p>
              This clause governs six distinct procedural contact protocols,
              each adapted to specific types of approach, exposure, or
              engagement intensity. It defines the only authorized path for
              formal engagement, negotiation, or contractual dialogue —
              regardless of role, hierarchy, or proximity.
            </p>

            <p>
              This protocol is not symbolic. It enforces ethical alignment
              before structural engagement. Any circumvention — including
              unannounced visits, ambiguous invites, or backchannel messages —
              will result in
              <a href="#" class="subtle-link">photo capture</a>,
              <a href="#" class="subtle-link">identity request</a>, and
              <a href="#" class="subtle-link">immediate archiving</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Contact attempts are <strong>automatically Git-logged</strong>. If
              deviation, threat, or ambiguity is detected, interactions are
              <strong>Ethereum-sealed</strong> to ensure sovereign traceability.
            </p>

            <p style="background-color: #e0e0e0">
              This clause may also be <strong>retroactively invoked</strong> by
              former collaborators or actors facing disqualification, as proof
              of documented integrity.

            <p>
              Enables the intake and classification of weak signals or informal

              silent expression of interest without commitment.
            </p>

            <h4 id="protocol-ii">Protocol II — Trace Intake™</h4>
            <p>
              Captures all traceable, timestamped expressions of approach,
              curiosity, or strategy — even if no direct contact is attempted.
              All passive signals are stored under Git Clause™.

              <li>
                <strong>Contact intention submission</strong> — via a visible,

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Response channel activation</strong> — if accepted, a

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Supervised encounter</strong> — involving lawyer,
                microphone, and sovereign witness if needed
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              All deviations are processed under Git Clause™, with potential

            <h4 id="protocol-iv">Protocol IV — Running Session Filter™</h4>
            <p>
              Encapsulates informal conversational proximity — typically

              probed. No legal discussion or engagement is permitted. All verbal
              contact here is filtered for ethical resonance and value
              misalignment. Incidents are flagged, not formalized.

            <p>
              Applies to physical or psychological breaches around the sovereign
              perimeter — including ambushes, intrusive monitoring, or
              unauthorized presence. Triggers identity logging, video capture,

              Defamation Clause™ if deflection, caricature, or unauthorized

            <p>
              This clause defines the formal activation threshold for the
              <em>Resolution Contractus™</em>. Once the minimum commitment of
              <strong>800,000 SEK</strong> is confirmed — either directly by
              transfer or through a co-signed escrow or legal agreement — the

            </p>

            <p>
              This clause acts as a <strong>strategic trigger</strong> — not
              only activating the contract, but also anchoring the timeframe,
              scope, and operating posture required for ethical resolution.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Timeframe:</strong> 45-day strategic window, during
                which all terms must be enacted or formally escalated.
              </li>
              <li>

              <li>
                <strong>Public Shielding:</strong> Propagation remains suspended

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Figures of Activation:</strong> At least one VP-level
                figure, a licensed legal intermediary, and an IP-qualified
                observer must be explicitly acknowledged.

              Should discretion be preferred, I remain open to

                that any <em>non-signatory figure</em> affected by the clause is

                pre-litigation, asset control dispute, structural obstruction).
                All access is <u>auditable</u>, and unilateral attempts trigger

                Delegated access may be granted under contract. Veto rights may

                <strong>Etymological Note:</strong> The term “RAM” originates
                from <em>Random Access Memory</em> — a hardware component in
                computing that allows instant, volatile data recall. Here, the
                term is reappropriated to describe
                <u>non-persistent memory access</u> in high-friction situations:
                precise, targeted, non-retroactive, and framed in legal-temporal
                logic.

                In several high-friction board environments, a structurally
                similar mechanism is referred to as
                <em>“Live RAM Access Clause”</em> — short for
                <em>Live Real-Time Access Memory</em>.

              <p style="font-style: italic; color: #666">
                The expression stems from computing architecture, where
                <strong>RAM (Random Access Memory)</strong> allows instant and
                temporary access to volatile data. In board contexts, the Live
                RAM variant refers to
                <u>real-time, unsanitized exposure logs</u>, accessible upon
                trigger — especially during

                The “<em>Live</em>” prefix signals that the access is active,
                streaming, and tethered to an evolving process.
                “<em>Real-Time</em>” anchors the clause within a legally
                auditable timeframe. “<em>Access Memory</em>” here designates a
                scoped window into
                <u>non-retroactive, sovereign operator memory</u> — including
                logged perceptions, behavior traces, or operational bifurcations
