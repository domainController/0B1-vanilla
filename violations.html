              <strong>📌 Context</strong><br />
              Following multiple unanswered messages requesting salary payment
              and documentation, a formal email was sent on January 26, 2025.<br />
              The email clearly outlined:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                an <strong>unpaid salary</strong> for work performed from Nov 23
                to Dec 15
              </li>
              <li>
                a <strong>missing payslip and contract</strong>, despite
                repeated demands
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>unrecorded overtime</strong>, particularly in the final
                two weeks
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The employer’s direct response was not a clarification, but an
              <strong>explicit mention of involving the police</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>📎 Context</h3>
            <p>
              After escalating his formal request on January 26, the claimant
              received a brief and hostile reply from Ms. Elnasser, followed
              within hours by a minimalistic technical reply from Mr. Siebert.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The response did not address <strong>unpaid overtime</strong> or
                <strong>missing payslips</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Instead, payment was made via
                <strong>unannounced postal checks</strong> without prior
                instruction — a method considered outdated and impractical.
              </li>
              <li>
                Henrik Siebert confirmed the payment with two reference numbers
                and advised to use Swedbank’s online platform.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The responsibility shift, from a panicked superior to a calmer
              subordinate, implicitly designated Mr. Siebert as the accountable
              legal interface.
            </p>

            <li>
              Multiple requests for clarification of contract terms, identity of

            </li>
            <li>

              constituted <em>opacity-by-design</em>.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Upon receiving a clear and structured legal letter, the company
              replied with

              This became the <strong>symbolic ignition point</strong> —
              confirming that structural negligence would be met with structural

            This section contains the original
            <strong>legal demand letter</strong> sent by the agent — then acting
            as a dishwasher in a subcontracted unit — followed by the official
            response received. These two documents together
            <em>constitute the symbolic ignition point</em> of the
            <strong>Ripple Effect</strong> and frame the legitimacy of the role.
          </p>
          <p>
            The letter was sent after repeated operational violations, including
            <strong
              >non-payment, contractual opacity, and unacknowledged
              status</strong
            >
            within the group. The response received offered a retroactive salary
            payment equivalent to two weeks, without acknowledging any of the
            claims.

            As such, it becomes the first proof of strategic negligence — and
            <strong>a durable marker of asymmetry</strong>. Its inclusion here
            is not to reopen conflict, but to trace the architecture of the role
            back to its ethical root.

          <h2>🗂 Note — Structural Origin</h2>
          <p>
            The Ripple Effect was not initiated from abstraction — it was born
            of lived experience and
            <strong>strategic failure at the periphery</strong>. The triggering
            moment: a dishwasher, unpaid and unrecognized, legally demanding
            visibility. The group’s response was minimal, transactional, and
            systemically blind.
          </p>
          <p>
            From this point emerged a conviction:
