            ⚠️ Early governance was shaped under constraint. The branding figure
            faced unresolved liabilities — including Skatteverket — that
            structurally barred formal registration under their name.
          </p>

          <p>
            Legal control was likely assigned to a <u>proxy founder</u> to

            Two figures jointly oversee <u>day-to-day operations</u>. One of
            them — commonly identified as the <u>informal cofounder</u> —
            remains legally invisible and detached from core operational tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <u>legal cofounder</u>, despite holding sole legal authority
            over the business, <em>has not been seen interacting</em> with
            either staff or his operational counterpart.

        <section id="operational-figure">
          <p>
            The active operational figure is the legal cofounder's partner:
            without any formal title, she handles onboarding, scheduling, and de
            facto HR, with no documented delegation line.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, she delegates heavily to a triad of N–1 figures —

          <p>
            While both engage intensively during those shifts, their appearances
            appeared irregular and uncoordinated
            <em>from the author’s vantage point</em>
            — no visible coordination, joint appearance, or witnessed
            communication was observed over a 3-week period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether this absence of joint presence stems from scheduling
            constraints or a deliberate operating model
            <em>remains undocumented</em>.

            Neither of the two figures handling day-to-day operations (informal
            cofounder and legal cofounder's partner) is responsible for site
            closures; opening duties remain unverified.
          </p>

          <p>
            The majority beneficial owner (50–75%) is the informal founder's
            partner, who remains off-site and has no known involvement while the
            legal cofounder holds only a minority share (&lt;25%)

          <p>
            The disconnection between economic control, active governance, and
            legal liability creates an immediate risk of strategic dilution.

⚠️ À revoir en relecture finale :

→ Risque de surcharge typographique (ex. : "legal", "partner", "informal" trop proches dans le même paragraphe).

→ Redondances de rôle à lisser :
  • “Two figures jointly oversee...” vs “neither… is responsible for site closures” — à regrouper ou synthétiser.
  • “branding figure” vs “creator of its organizational identity” — possible fusion : "branding figure with organizational authorship".

→ Choisir UNE seule forme de mise en relief par rôle :
