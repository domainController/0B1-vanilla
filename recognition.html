        <h1>Non-Recapture Clauses</h1>

        <p>
          The <strong>Non-Recapture Clauses</strong> represent a distinct
          contractual family operating within the
          <a href="/nrz.html" class="nav-link">Non-Recapture Zone™</a>. These
          clauses do not aim to resolve conflicts (like A-Clauses), nor to
          prepare replication protocols (like B-Clauses), but to formally encode
          <strong>non-recapture rights</strong> — sovereign acts of narrative
          erasure, redirection of licensing revenue, and creation of funds
          acknowledging silenced operators.
        </p>

        <p>
          They exist to shield the structural contribution of erased or
          underestimated actors, without feeding litigation or spectacle. Each
          clause is an irreversible recognition device — short, surgical, and
          sovereign.
        </p>
        <section id="c1-erased-association">
          <h3>C1 — Right to Erased Association™</h3>
          <blockquote>
            “You cannot buy the framework. You can only pay to not be
            remembered.”
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This clause grants any institution, executive, or board indirectly
            involved in the genesis of the framework a limited opportunity to
            <strong>buy their absence</strong> from the narrative record — under
            strict, verifiable conditions.

              <strong>No ownership rights</strong> can be granted over the

            </li>
            <li>

                <li>
                  No metadata, clue, or timeline anchor will link the actor to
                  the case.

              retroactively.
            </li>
            <li>
              After expiration (e.g. 18 months), the clause may be
              <strong>renewed or released</strong>, at sovereign discretion.

          <p>
            <em>Purpose:</em> To provide a last-resort off-ramp for institutions
            seeking to distance themselves from the narrative after structural
            failure, without diluting the framework or corrupting its licensing
            path.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            Clause C1 acts as a <strong>diplomatic lever</strong>: it does
            <em>not erase what happened</em> — it only creates a
            <strong>controlled silence</strong>.

          <h3>C2 — Creation of the Silent Operators Fund™</h3>
          <p>
            A distinct and autonomous redistribution fund — named
            <strong>Silent Operators Fund™</strong> — shall be formally
            established to receive, hold, and distribute the portion of
            licensing revenue dedicated to historically silenced or overlooked
            operators.
          </p>

          <p>This fund shall operate under four guiding principles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Discretion</strong> — Beneficiaries may remain unnamed,
              anonymous, or encrypted within the sovereign records.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trace-Based Eligibility</strong> — Any verifiable signal,
              testimony, or contribution (even indirect) that shaped the
              emergence of the present framework qualifies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Application Required</strong> — Allocation may be
              initiated unilaterally by the author or by sovereign observers
              appointed within the future governance structure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Posthumous Eligibility</strong> — If needed, symbolic
              transfers may be made to relatives, communities, or causes aligned
              with the beneficiary’s trajectory.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This clause shall enter into force immediately upon first licensing
            income, even provisional. The fund may be audited narratively, but
            never diluted contractually.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="c3-redistribution-silenced">
          <h3>C3 — Redistribution Toward the Silenced™</h3>
          <p>
            Up to <strong>33%</strong> of any licensing revenue generated by
            this framework — including but not limited to Silence Licenses™,
            Strategic Buyouts™, or Preventive Agreements™ — will be redirected
            toward a compensation fund for historically silenced operators.
          </p>

          <p>
            This includes any individual whose suffering, silence, trace, or
            partial testimony has structurally contributed to the emergence,
            necessity, or urgency of this framework. Their names may remain
            unspoken. Their voices, unheard. But their signals shaped the
            system. Their pain is embedded in its clauses.
          </p>

          <p>
            This clause shall be considered <strong>irrevocable</strong>. Any
            attempt to bypass, defer, or dilute this redistribution duty shall
            trigger the Sovereign Clause A.14 – “Trigger-to-CC Publication.”
