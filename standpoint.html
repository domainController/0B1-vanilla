        <h2>
          üß≠ Negotiation Context ‚Äî Strategic Reorientation After Structural Loss
        </h2>
        <p>
          After 15 years of delay, I was finally ready:
          <strong>dedicated gear</strong>, <strong>stable income</strong>, and a
          full year of <strong>uninterrupted coding</strong> ahead. Proposal was
          entering phase 2 ‚Äî Malm√∂ execution ‚Äî with no external debt, no
          investors, no noise. Then <em>Quan</em> collapsed. Overnight,
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">8 months were lost</mark>. No
          car, no housing, no incorporation rights. This section outlines
          <u>what was sacrificed</u>, and
          <u>why compensation must support a dual-track recovery</u> ‚Äî one leg
          in SME operations, the other in rural autonomy.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first time since 2011, I had secured a
          <strong>real chance to launch</strong> my startup: a stable roof (or
          at least consistent desk access),
          <strong>Swedish unemployment income</strong>, and
          <strong>a clear year ahead</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>I had everything I needed to execute Proposal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A dedicated office</strong>, 24/7</li>
          <li><strong>My own hardware</strong>, fully acquired from savings</li>
          <li><strong>The mental space to build</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Time</strong> ‚Äî which I never had before</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          My goal was to
          <strong>bootstrap the company without external capital</strong>. The
          missing pieces were minimal: a used car, company creation funds, and
          modest housing.
        </p>

        <p>
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">Plan A</mark>: launch Proposal
          with no distractions and write code every day.
        </p>

        <p>
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">Plan B</mark>: if all else
          failed, <strong>sustain myself</strong> one year on Swedish benefits,
          sleep rough if needed, and <strong>ship Proposal daily</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then came <em>Quan</em>. The legal violations, governance fraud, and
          passive sabotage made it <strong>mentally impossible</strong> to
          ignore. I shelved everything. Not out of choice ‚Äî but necessity.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>8 months lost</strong>. I‚Äôve coded maybe 1 month during that
          period. No car. Still no status to incorporate. No fixed address. I
          remain outside.
        </p>

        <h2>üìç Strategic Clarity ‚Äî Why This Path Was Mapped</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Proposal was structured in 3 stages: gear / Malm√∂ / rural autonomy
          </li>
          <li>
            I had already passed stage 1 and launched stage 2 before the crash
          </li>
          <li>Plan A and B were defined before arrival ‚Äî no improvisation</li>
          <li>
            I had just received a raise ‚Äî proof of early recognition and
            momentum
          </li>
          <li>
            This wasn‚Äôt a lucky break. <strong>It was earned</strong>, and then
            destroyed
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. A Strategic Pivot Toward Acquisition</h2>

        <p>
          Until recently, my goal was straightforward:
          <strong>buy a car</strong>, upgrade some gear, and stabilize. But this
          experience has triggered a pivot. I now think
          <strong>in terms of buying a company</strong> ‚Äî even a minority stake
          ‚Äî rather than spending on depreciating assets. This isn't just a wish;
          it's becoming
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">a new axis of reasoning</mark
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to be able to <u>analyze a company myself</u>, ask the right
          questions, <strong>read financial statements</strong> with confidence,
          and understand whether I‚Äôm buying a ticking time bomb or a viable
          structure. If I can do that alone first, before hiring advisors, I‚Äôll
          be in control of my decisions and my money.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plan is simple: <u>learn to audit companies</u>, understand their
          internal flows, governance, liabilities, and true potential ‚Äî and from
          there, <strong>acquire intelligently</strong>. It‚Äôs not about ego.
          It‚Äôs about protecting what I invest, especially when every euro
          matters.
        </p>

        <p>
          And if I don‚Äôt do it with you, I‚Äôll do it without you. I‚Äôll code three
          months, then find another business, probably in tech, to apply this
          exact mindset. Because now I think like a buyer ‚Äî and that‚Äôs
          irreversible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Is this a trend? Maybe.
          <strong>But I doubt it‚Äôs a passing one</strong>. There will always be
          fewer acquirers than builders. It‚Äôs
          <u>riskier, harder, less glamorous</u> ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what filters the
          crowd. In the words of Peter Thiel:
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >"Competition is for losers."</mark
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          And this, right now, is a perfect storm. A generational shift.
          Hundreds of businesses are <strong>exiting or collapsing</strong>. The
          doors are open, but only for those who know how to look. That‚Äôs the
          game I‚Äôm learning to play.
