        <h1>Welcome to OB1</h1>
        <br>
        <p>OB1 is a platform designed to connect individuals working off-hours and facing legal or professional challenges. It’s a space for support, solidarity, and exchange.</p>
  
        <p>In order to foster collaboration and support, OB1 introduces the concept of <strong>Circles</strong>. A Circle is a way for like-minded individuals to gather based on shared interests or needs. We offer three types of circles:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Forum Circles</strong> – A forum hosted on OB1, organized by specific topics (coming soon).</li>
            <li><strong>Message Circles</strong> – Real-time peer exchange through messaging platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Circles</strong> – Informal connections via social media platforms such as Facebook.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To facilitate this, OB1 is preparing a registration form. This form will allow you to sign up for the <strong>Forum Circles</strong> and other Circle types as they become available. While the registration form is being prepared, you can still explore OB1’s mission and get ready to join our community.</p>
