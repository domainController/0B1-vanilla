          <p>
            This document does not claim to uncover hidden scandals or deliver
            forensic revelations. It simply connects
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >visible strategic signals</mark
            >
            — across ownership structures, governance behavior, and cultural
            alignment — using a logic of coherence rather than accusation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some scenarios may appear sensitive, not because of severity, but
            because they rely on <strong>pattern analysis</strong>: governance
            gaps, role ambiguities, or signals of misalignment. That’s why this
            content is shared via <strong>controlled distribution</strong>,
            requiring both
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">identity verification</mark>
            and <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">manual approval</mark>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>This is not a whistleblower note.</strong> It’s a structured
            audit of what a misaligned leadership culture looks like — before
            the rupture. Treat it as a stress test, not a prosecution.
