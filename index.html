        <h2>For Elite High-Level Management</h2>

        Reserved for
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">field-embedded managers</mark>
        and
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">operational relays</mark>
        directly exposed to crisis dynamics. These pages offer actionable
        framings to <strong>stabilize weak governance zones</strong>,
        <strong>detect internal leverage</strong>, and
        <strong>support post-founder realignment</strong>.
      </section>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Proxy Logic</strong> — Decodes how legal invisibility, dormant
          entities, and operational obfuscation merge into structural opacity.
          Identifies “Cold Zones” where responsibility is rerouted or erased.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Viability Scan (V1)</strong> — Methodology used to scan a site
          through immersion. Based on listening, embedded observation, and cold
          analysis. Produces a structured Pilot Memo® assessing the real
          viability of the organization .
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ethical Dissemination</strong> — Structured dissemination
          protocol — designed to trigger an emergent moral figure, capable of
          absorbing weak signals across silos. Activated when executive-level
          refusal leaves internal gaps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact Protocol</strong> — Licensed interface. Filters all
          inbound interactions and logs violations. Core artifact of narrative
          sovereignty.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>For Executive Leadership of Elite Hotels</h2>
      <p>
        Intended for
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >site-level executives and high-exposure decision-makers</mark
        >. These materials highlight
        <strong>latent operational conflicts</strong>,
        <strong>personnel governance gaps</strong>, and
        <strong>site-triggered dissociation cascades</strong>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Dissociated Governance</strong> — Internal misalignments,
          informal power channels, and absence of arbitration layers. Maps the
          fragility of current site governance under pressure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact Protocol</strong> — Licensed interface. Filters all
          inbound interactions and logs violations. Core artifact of narrative
          sovereignty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ultimatum Letter</strong> — Final bifurcation: triggers
          Scenario 1 (strategic mirroring) or Scenario 2 (adaptation contract).
          Root of all sovereign clauses.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>For Board Delegates & Governance Oversight</h2>
      <p>
        Reserved for
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >non-operational board members, legal stewards, and equity-aligned
          governance figures</mark
        >. These documents help surface
        <strong>structural opacity risks</strong>,
        <strong>non-disclosed dissociation patterns</strong>, and
        <strong>early acquisition misalignment indicators</strong>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Exit Intelligence Suite </strong> — Framework for classifying
          field incidents and latent dysfunctions into LP-GP actionable risk
          categories. Reserved for board-level oversight, legal teams, and fund
          governance observers.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Pilot Memo</strong> — Operational scan of internal fractures.
          First-hand signals, typologies, and field analysis. Designed for
          board-level urgency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sovereign Clauses</strong> — Strategic terms that structure
          the offer. Each clause encodes a trigger, a shield, or a narrative
          safeguard.

          <strong>Ultimatum Letter</strong> — Final bifurcation: triggers
