            It took only a few minutes to detect. No ambiguity, no complexity —
            just a visible lack of shared framework between both leads. This is
            not a skill marker. It’s a textbook case.
          </p>

          <p>
            The observations below are valid, but not generalisable. They do not
            apply to more complex cases — this one was
            <strong>exceptionally transparent</strong>. My contribution here
            lies in documenting it, not solving it.

          This concept emerges from the ambiguity explored in
          <strong>Responsibility & Anonymity</strong> — where official roles
          blur and informal authority takes over. It doesn't just weaken trust;
          it <u>produces parallel systems</u> with distinct codes, hierarchies,
          and allegiances.
        </p>
        <p>
          The breakdown didn’t come from financial fragility — it came from a
          <strong>failed co-founding equation</strong>. When the two people
          holding operational and symbolic power lack shared values, the rest
          collapses. This is not theory: it happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          What follows isn’t a narrative. It’s a signal log. A series of
          operational asymmetries, disguised hierarchies, and contradicting
          signals — collected from inside. You will not find names. Only
          structure.

        <h2>📍 Steakhouse Origins – Deferred Trust, Controlled Capital</h2>

        <p>
          📅 <u>Between 2000 and 2014</u>, Saahil Chudasama appears only as
          <em>suppleant</em> (alternate) in company protocols of Steakhouse
          Lilla Torg AB. Despite describing himself as
          <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saahil-alexander-chudasama-a194a3111/"
            class="subtle-link"
            >“CEO & Part Owner”</a
          >, official records show he had no real authority or control during
          this period.
        </p>

        <p>
          🧾 In 2010, at age 30, he holds
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >just 45 shares out of 1,500</mark
          >, equal to 3%. His father Jayantilal Chudasama holds 94%, and all
          voting power. No role in decision-making. His name is absent from
          license applications and board signatories.
        </p>

        <p>
          ⚠️ A key record from 2012 —
          <a href="#" class="subtle-link">alcohol license transfer</a> —
          confirms the governance perimeter: the board is limited to his father
          and his brother-in-law
          <a
            href="https://www.allabolag.se/befattningshavare/joakim-heden-invest-ab/malm%C3%B6/reklambyr%C3%A5er/2KH7KMQI5YGSK"
            class="subtle-link"
            >Joachim Hedén</a
          >. Saahil remains alternate. At age 32, he is still considered too
          peripheral for operational trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          🧠 The pattern suggests
          <u>symbolic succession without functional trust</u>. Even after his
          father's death in 2014, Saahil becomes only “Managing Director” —
          while his mother Ingrid Jeanette Chudasama remains Chair and majority
          shareholder (75–80%). He holds at most 3–5% of shares.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h2>🚧 Sliders & Shakes – Franchise as Financial Escape</h2>

        <p>
          📅 <u>In 2017</u>, Saahil (37) launches
          <a
            href="https://aftershift.se/structure.html#sliders-and-shakes"
            class="internal-link"
            >Sliders & Shakes AB</a
          >. Unlike the family restaurant, this new company is located in Malmö
          Central Station — high visibility, small surface, optimized for
          scalability. It is
          <strong>clearly structured as a franchise pilot</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          👨‍🍳 Press interviews and early team composition — including Sachin
          Gore, reportedly from Five Guys — confirm the format: miniature
          gourmet burgers, U.S. branding, handcrafted shakes. The ambition is
          not stability, but
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >scale, visibility, and capital leverage</mark
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          📉 The venture fails. Company records later reveal bankruptcy, closing
          the expansion route. But the intent remains readable:
          <strong>Sliders & Shakes was a bid for independence</strong>. It was
          about escaping the slow, invisible stagnation of his family structure.
        </p>

        <p>
          🧬 In founder psychology, such moves resemble “narrative resets” —
          where the founder rebrands himself through a new vehicle. This one
          <u>was engineered for replication and capital, not craft or legacy</u
          >.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px">

          />
        </div>

        <h2>📈 Quan Restaurant – Second Attempt, New Surface</h2>

        <p>
          📅 <u>In 2018</u>, Saahil launches a second company:
          <strong>Quan Restaurant</strong>. This time in partnership, but still
          within walking distance from the family restaurant. It positions
          itself as <u>premium pan-Asian, nightlife-adjacent</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
          🧩 While not structurally a franchise, Quan reflects the same DNA:
          external partnerships, independent capital, upscale branding. It is
          not an artisanal detour — it's a continuation of the escape model,
          this time
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">with risk-sharing</mark>.
        </p>

        <p>
          📌 From Steakhouse to Quan, the pattern holds:
          <strong
            >fractional ownership, deferred recognition, repeated
            detachment</strong
          >. Not rebellion, but redirection — always away from the family
          nucleus, always toward capital control.

      </p>

      <p>
        It lays out transparent proposals with concrete logic, compensation
        terms, and equity redistribution. The aim isn’t just to exit — it’s

      <h2>🎯 Philosophy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Logic-first</strong>: Tactical and unemotional. Proposals
          follow a time-bound, non-negotiable structure.

      </ul>

      <h2>🔁 Exit Logic</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Operational Deadlock</strong>: Inability to reinvest, reform,
          or reset governance internally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Brand Contagion</strong>: Elite’s public image is now
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">exposed via affiliation</mark
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Network Spillover</strong>: Supplier, press, and staff
          channels are structurally contaminated.

      <h2>⏱️ Soft Deadline Logic</h2>
      <p>
        Each offer is governed by a <strong>72h soft deadline</strong>. Beyond
        that, publication is automatic. No one can afford to stall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Offers are calibrated to

    <h1>Exit Strategy</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>🔍 Trigger & Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Trigger event:</strong> The governance crisis erupted after an
        altercation between <a href="#" class="internal-link">Sahar</a> and an
        employee, under <a href="#" class="internal-link">Henrik Siebert</a>'s
        passive watch. The incident revealed the absence of strategic guardrails
        and a deeply informal management structure.
      </p>
      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        Henrik failed by inertia, Sahar by aggression.
        <u>No visible communication between the two leads</u>.
        <strong>Responsibilities were avoided on both sides</strong>. Parallel
        tracks, weak stress management.
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >The collapse stemmed from a lack of initial and strategic
          alignment</mark
        >.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Design Flaw</h2>
        <p>
          Putting two people at the top of a new venture means forming a
          <strong>co-founding team</strong>.
          <strong>Investors never fund ideas</strong> — they fund teams. A real
          team means
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">shared values</mark>,
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">shared history</mark>, and the
          ability to <strong>handle tension without breaking</strong>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>The Miscast</h2>
      <p>
        The actual <strong>design flaw</strong> wasn’t Sahar’s behavior — it was
        <strong>Sahail’s absence from operations</strong>. He had the history,
        the adversity, the shared scars with Henrik.
        <u>He should have been in the room</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, Sahar —
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >a first-time operator with poor stress resilience</mark
        >
        — was left to absorb daily tension she wasn’t trained for. The core
        failure wasn’t intent, but a
        <strong>misplaced delegation of roles</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Founder's Job Misunderstood</h2>
      <p>
        One of the founder’s role is to
        <strong>handle the hardest problems</strong>. Same with tensions. It’s
        your job to
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >tackle uncomfortable issues</mark
        >
        and
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >initiate difficult conversations</mark
        >. If you avoid those, <strong>you’re not doing your part</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>What Could Have Saved It</h2>
      <p>
        In a proven business model like restaurants, you can offset weak
        chemistry —
        <strong>but only if you write everything down</strong>.
        <u>Mission, vision, values, roles, culture</u> — all must be explicit.
        Then you talk.
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">
          You sit down before, and you keep talking throughout</mark

    <section>
      <h2><mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">📊 Final Note</mark></h2>
      <p>
        <strong>This wasn’t a failure of intention</strong>. It was a
        <strong>failure of design</strong>.
        <u>The structure wasn’t built for tension</u>. And when pressure came,
        it broke where no foundation had ever been laid.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>🔍 Preliminary Forecast: Likely Moves</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ❌ <strong>Remove visible crisis agents</strong> — Sahar and Henrik
          Siebert
        </li>
        <li>
          ⚡ <strong>Freeze silent shareholders</strong> — Daniella Dahl, others

        <li>
          💼 <strong>Assign Saahil a co-directorship role</strong> — loyal,
          low-profile figure
        </li>
        <li>
          🍳 <strong>Hand operational control to Henrik Kling</strong> —
          continuity with culinary credibility
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>🧭 Structured Departure Pathways</h2>
      <p>
        A transition scenario is currently under review by the hotel board. It
        aims to allow <strong>Henrik Kling</strong> to exit his executive role
        without reputational damage while preserving the restaurant’s
        operational momentum. The hotel considers this option viable if the Chef
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >publicly supports the continuity</mark
        >
        of the concept and remains available for consultation post-exit.
      </p>

      <h2>💸 Partial Buy-Out with Time-Limited Collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        A mid-scenario involves Elite Hotels initiating a
        <u>partial acquisition of HSSC Event AB</u>, offering Sahil and Henrik a
        premium buyout conditioned on their continued involvement for a defined
        period (e.g., 6–12 months). This would ensure a
        <strong>stable handover</strong> and maintain culinary excellence during
        transition. The proposal would be discreetly framed as a strategic
        reallocation of operational focus.
      </p>

      <h2>⚠️ Clean Break under Financial Duress</h2>
      <p>
        If no amicable solution emerges, the hotel may initiate a clean
        operational severance citing
        <strong
          >financial misalignment, lack of transparency, or reputational
          risk</strong
        >. This scenario implies high legal scrutiny and a potential freeze of
        current contracts. However, it exposes Elite Hotel to
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">counterclaims</mark> unless
        strong documentation is gathered in advance.
      </p>

      <h2>🛡️ Legal Containment & Risk Framing</h2>
      <p>
        In all cases, the strategy revolves around building a
        <strong>paper trail of legitimate concern</strong>: absence of long-term
        strategic vision, <u>excessive financial extraction</u>, or dissonance
        in values. This narrative is crucial for internal justification and
        legal preparedness. Such a positioning also allows the group to
        <strong>maintain control over PR</strong> while offering stakeholders a
        plausible explanation.

      <h2>👁 Hidden Risk Factors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ❌ Henrik: <em>reputation-damaging history</em>, visible scandal
          factor
        </li>
        <li>
          ⚡ Sahar: <em>conflict-prone, poor crisis handling</em>, no longer
          credible with staff
        </li>
        <li>
          ☑ Saahil: <em>low public exposure, holds symbolic legitimacy</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>🔎 Strategic Recommendation</h2>
      <p>
        Eliminate dual opacity (Henrik + Sahar). Transfer all day-to-day roles
        to <strong>qualified third-party operators</strong> with domain
        expertise (Asian cuisine, hospitality ops).
      </p>
      <p>
        Require <strong>in-person commitment from Saahil</strong> in any future
        governance role. No more passive proxy.

      <h2>🧭 Henrik Siebert – Strategic Exit Guidance</h2>

      <p>
        <strong
          >After five years of leadership, Henrik has turned the site into a
          <u>benchmark for high-end dining in Malmö</u>.</strong
        >
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >Revenue reached 41.1 MSEK in 2023</mark
        >
        with an
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >after-tax profit of 5.29 MSEK</mark
        >. The restaurant holds a <u>three-week waiting list</u> and has become
        a <strong>cash engine</strong> and reputational pillar for the hotel
        group.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >But Henrik's late-stage posture reveals a growing
          <u>value misalignment</u> with the group.</strong
        >
        His role shifted toward
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">financial extraction</mark> over
        long-term strategic alignment. This logic also shaped the operational
        structure — including <u>incoherent role assignments</u> and
        <strong>unstable management pairings</strong>.
      </p>

      <p><strong>We recommend a clean, honorable exit</strong>, built on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>✅ Recognition</strong>: Acknowledge Henrik as the
          <em>founder and architect</em> of the premium model.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>📤 Transition</strong>: Plan a short-term disengagement with
          clear handovers and limited visibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>💸 Buyout</strong>: Propose a controlled financial settlement
          to avoid long-tail disruption or claims.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>This ensures:</strong> no public scandal, no internal fracture,
        and a narrative of <u>strategic maturity</u>, not expulsion. It
        preserves investor confidence and
