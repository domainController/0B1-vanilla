            It took only a few minutes to detect. No ambiguity, no complexity —
            just a visible lack of shared framework between both leads. This is
            not a skill marker. It’s a textbook case.

          <p>
            The observations below are valid, but not generalisable. They do not
            apply to more complex cases — this one was
            <strong>exceptionally transparent</strong>. My contribution here
            lies in documenting it, not solving it.

        <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>Brand Contagion</strong>: Elite’s public image is now

      <h1>Exit Strategy</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>🔍 Trigger & Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Trigger event:</strong> The governance crisis erupted after an
          altercation between <a href="#" class="internal-link">Sahar</a> and an
          employee, under <a href="#" class="internal-link">Henrik Siebert</a>'s
          passive watch. The incident revealed the absence of strategic
          guardrails and a deeply informal management structure.
        </p>
        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
          Henrik failed by inertia, Sahar by aggression.
          <u>No visible communication between the two leads</u>.
          <strong>Responsibilities were avoided on both sides</strong>. Parallel
          tracks, weak stress management.
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >The collapse stemmed from a lack of initial and strategic
            alignment</mark
          >.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>Design Flaw</h2>
          <p>
            Putting two people at the top of a new venture means forming a
            <strong>co-founding team</strong>.
            <strong>Investors never fund ideas</strong> — they fund teams. A
            real team means
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">shared values</mark>,
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">shared history</mark>, and
            the ability to <strong>handle tension without breaking</strong>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <h2>The Miscast</h2>
        <p>
          The actual <strong>design flaw</strong> wasn’t Sahar’s behavior — it
          was <strong>Sahail’s absence from operations</strong>. He had the
          history, the adversity, the shared scars with Henrik.
          <u>He should have been in the room</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, Sahar —
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >a first-time operator with poor stress resilience</mark
          >
          — was left to absorb daily tension she wasn’t trained for. The core
          failure wasn’t intent, but a
          <strong>misplaced delegation of roles</strong>.

          In a proven business model like restaurants, you can offset weak
          chemistry —
          <strong>but only if you write everything down</strong>.
          <u>Mission, vision, values, roles, culture</u> — all must be explicit.

      <section>
        <h2>🧭 Structured Departure Pathways</h2>
        <p>
          A transition scenario is currently under review by the hotel board. It
          aims to allow <strong>Henrik Kling</strong> to exit his executive role
          without reputational damage while preserving the restaurant’s
          operational momentum. The hotel considers this option viable if the
          Chef
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >publicly supports the continuity</mark
          >
          of the concept and remains available for consultation post-exit.
        </p>

        <h2>💸 Partial Buy-Out with Time-Limited Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
          A mid-scenario involves Elite Hotels initiating a
          <u>partial acquisition of HSSC Event AB</u>, offering Sahil and Henrik
          a premium buyout conditioned on their continued involvement for a
          defined period (e.g., 6–12 months). This would ensure a
          <strong>stable handover</strong> and maintain culinary excellence
          during transition. The proposal would be discreetly framed as a
          strategic reallocation of operational focus.
        </p>

        <h2>⚠️ Clean Break under Financial Duress</h2>
        <p>
          If no amicable solution emerges, the hotel may initiate a clean
          operational severance citing
          <strong
            >financial misalignment, lack of transparency, or reputational
            risk</strong
          >. This scenario implies high legal scrutiny and a potential freeze of
          current contracts. However, it exposes Elite Hotel to
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">counterclaims</mark> unless
          strong documentation is gathered in advance.
        </p>

        <h2>🛡️ Legal Containment & Risk Framing</h2>
        <p>
          In all cases, the strategy revolves around building a
          <strong>paper trail of legitimate concern</strong>: absence of
          long-term strategic vision, <u>excessive financial extraction</u>, or
          dissonance in values. This narrative is crucial for internal
          justification and legal preparedness. Such a positioning also allows
          the group to <strong>maintain control over PR</strong> while offering
          stakeholders a plausible explanation.

        <h2>👁 Hidden Risk Factors</h2>

            factor

      <section>
        <h2>🔎 Strategic Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          Eliminate dual opacity (Henrik + Sahar). Transfer all day-to-day roles
          to <strong>qualified third-party operators</strong> with domain
          expertise (Asian cuisine, hospitality ops).
        </p>
        <p>
          Require <strong>in-person commitment from Saahil</strong> in any
          future governance role. No more passive proxy.

            >After five years of leadership, Henrik has turned the site into a
            <u>benchmark for high-end dining in Malmö</u>.</strong

          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >Revenue reached 41.1 MSEK in 2023</mark
          >
          with an

            >after-tax profit of 5.29 MSEK</mark
          >. The restaurant holds a <u>three-week waiting list</u> and has
          become a <strong>cash engine</strong> and reputational pillar for the
          hotel group.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >But Henrik's late-stage posture reveals a growing
            <u>value misalignment</u> with the group.</strong
          >
          His role shifted toward
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">financial extraction</mark>
          over long-term strategic alignment. This logic also shaped the
          operational structure — including
          <u>incoherent role assignments</u> and
          <strong>unstable management pairings</strong>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>We recommend a clean, honorable exit</strong>, built on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>✅ Recognition</strong>: Acknowledge Henrik as the
            <em>founder and architect</em> of the premium model.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>📤 Transition</strong>: Plan a short-term disengagement with
            clear handovers and limited visibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>💸 Buyout</strong>: Propose a controlled financial
            settlement to avoid long-tail disruption or claims.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>This ensures:</strong> no public scandal, no internal
          fracture, and a narrative of <u>strategic maturity</u>, not expulsion.
          It preserves investor confidence and
