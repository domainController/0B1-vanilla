      <h1>üì¨ Contact Integrity Filter</h1>

      <p>
        Those raised without values ‚Äî or who failed to acquire any ‚Äî trigger an
        irreversible downgrade in moral rank. No restoration possible. Polished
        manners concealing intent, or sardonic smiles veiling contempt,
        instantly initiate scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any request for a physical meeting ‚Äî formal or informal ‚Äî will be
        treated as structural input. The person sent will be logged, archived,
        and recorded as the origin point of a documentation process. These
        meetings provide initial raw material for confidential letters and
        ongoing strategic research.
      </p>

      <p>
        If strategic deceit is detected, latent exposure protocols are not only
        activated ‚Äî they cascade. Accountability propagates vertically,
        affecting those who authorized, enabled, or sheltered the actor. What
        may begin as a simple trace becomes, by design, a narrative breach
        point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inclusion in a confidential archive then becomes structurally inevitable
        ‚Äî and may carry irreversible reputational consequences for the entire
        chain of affiliation. This is not symbolic. It is procedural.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if the findings are deemed structurally compromising ‚Äî with the
        potential to destabilize the broader ecosystem ‚Äî they will not be
        published. Preservation of systemic equilibrium takes precedence over
        exposure. The integrity of the chain will be maintained, even when
        significant breaches are detected.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don‚Äôt shake hands on first contact ‚Äî and sometimes not until long
        after. I maintain that distance until alignment has been proven ‚Äî
        through action. It‚Äôs not about politeness. My self-honesty ranks above
        protocol.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >To contact me, choose the track that matches your intent.</strong

      <h2>Protocol I ‚Äî üîê Signal-based Contact Integrity Filter</h2>

      <p>
        This access channel is reserved for individuals carrying weak signals,
        internal alerts, or whistleblower-level concerns. To initiate contact,
        you must:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Swish 100 SEK</strong> to <strong>0760076374</strong></li>
        <li>
          <strong>Send a short intent message</strong> via WhatsApp or e-mail
          (no LinkedIn)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Include your Swedish personal number</strong> (for
          traceability)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attach at least two converging indicators</strong> ‚Äî one of
          which must be verifiable (e.g. document, timeline, audio trace)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Initial meeting is one-on-one. We walk, we talk, I listen ‚Äî and test the
        signal. If what you share proves substantial or sensitive enough, I may
        invite my lawyer to join for a second round. Not for confrontation ‚Äî but
        for clarity, structure, and advice. We listen together, then debrief in
        private.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you prefer not to meet ‚Äî or to remain anonymous ‚Äî you may still send
        a file, a link, a pattern, or simply say: ‚Äúlook there.‚Äù No personal
        information is required. Silent traces speak too. I‚Äôll assess their
        value.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Special attention is given to any attempt to misuse Protocol I as a
          backdoor to avoid Protocol II.</em
        >
        Consequences of such tactics are outlined in the
        <a href="#contact-intro">introduction</a>.

        <h3>Protocol II ‚Äì Submit a Lucidity Trace ‚Äî No reply expected</h3>

        <p>
          If you wish to share formal signs of lucidity or alignment ‚Äî without
          dialogue, without expectation ‚Äî you may use this protocol. This
          includes a past CV, an internal note, a private log, or any silent
          signal of positioning.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>This protocol does not trigger a response.</li>
          <li>
            It will be treated as a one-way trace, archived as potential
            strategic material.
          </li>
          <li>
            It neutralizes opportunistic dynamics while offering a discreet
            signal of loyalty or clarity.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Examples of accepted traces include: CVs, anonymous notes, excerpts
          from unjust decisions, or quiet reports of strategic misalignment.
        </p>

        <p class="strategic-note">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Every trace received may become part of a
          larger narrative map ‚Äî used to identify lucid actors, dissident
          trajectories, or future coalitions. No reply will be issued. No
          solicitation will follow.
        </p>
      </section>
      <hr />
      <h3>Protocol III ‚Äî Legal, Business, Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
        You email me. I review your request on my own time, without guarantee of
        reply. If your intent is coherent, I send you a formal quote ‚Äî typically
        starting at 25,000 SEK ‚Äî to trigger any written reply, review, or
        strategic attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it moves forward, I show up with legal counsel. In most cases, a
        microphone is placed on the table.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Protocol IV ‚Äî Informal Contact Integrity Filter</h2>

      <p>
        To initiate informal contact, send your
        <strong>personal text (~100 lines)</strong> via
        <strong>WhatsApp</strong>, <strong>email</strong>, or
        <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, alongside:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Your LinkedIn profile</strong> (or equivalent professional ID)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Your Swedish personal number</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Swish 250 SEK</strong> to <strong>0760076374</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p style="margin-top: 1em">
        The <strong>personal text</strong> should include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your <strong>personal values</strong> (primary focus)</li>
        <li>
          If your are a leader: the values and culture you promote within your
          organization
        </li>
        <li>
          Formative and painful experiences ‚Äî and what you‚Äôve learned from them
        </li>
        <li>The urgency that leads you here</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        AI assistance is welcome ‚Äî but tolerated up to <strong>25%</strong> max.
      </p>

      <p>
        If accepted, we meet for a <strong>1-hour run</strong>. Minimum pace:
        <strong>10 km/h</strong> for the first 45 minutes.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>15 min warm-up</strong>: we discuss personal values, defining
          experiences, short/long-term vision, and key readings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>30 min steady run</strong>: we explore the reasons you reached
          out and what you expect from this contact.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Final 15 min ‚Äî 5 sprints</strong>: ~10‚Äì15 seconds each, full
          speed, spaced by 3‚Äì4 min active recovery.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Junior analysts are welcome ‚Äî but must come in their
        <strong>own name</strong>.

        <h3>Protocol V ‚Äî Supervised Appearances</h3>
        <p>
          In select high-stakes contexts ‚Äî legal transitions, board-level
          summons, or formal resolution sessions ‚Äî I may appear in person,
          accompanied by professional security.
        </p>
        <p>
          This applies exclusively to closed-door situations where legal,
          reputational, or structural risk is present. Security presence is
          non-negotiable.
        </p>
        <p>
          In strategic gatherings (panels, conferences, joint reviews), Protocol
          IV may combine with Protocol II. Attendance is conditional and
          assessed on a case-by-case basis.
        </p>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <h3>Protocol VI ‚Äî Unsolicited Appearances & Protective Presence</h3>
      <p>
        I do not attend by invitation. Public presence occurs by sovereign
        decision only.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you see me in public, assume it‚Äôs deliberate ‚Äî and that protective
        presence will be active. No one should attempt to frame such appearances
        as collaborative, spontaneous, or cordial.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I appear, protective presence will always be active. No assumption
        should be made regarding informality, reconciliation, or openness to
        collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contact attempts triggered by such appearances are automatically
        filtered through prior records and behavioral signals.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        Every contact attempt ‚Äî regardless of tone or channel ‚Äî activates a
        silent mapping process. I review patterns, affiliations, and past
        trajectories. It‚Äôs not surveillance. It‚Äôs structure. It allows me to
        read context before engaging. Authentic signals strengthen trust.
        Weaponized ambiguity triggers narrative defenses ‚Äî often irreversibly.
      </p>

      <p>
        I tend to trust those who leave visible traces ‚Äî even messy, imperfect
        ones ‚Äî over those who conceal everything. Visibility signals courage.
        Silence, too often, shelters manipulation.
      </p>

      <p>
        All contact attempts are filtered and archived. Inappropriate messages
        will be ignored.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 2em; font-size: 0.95em; color: #555">
        This contact protocol forms part of an early-stage artifact ‚Äî the

        limited license, it is designed to shape high-integrity interactions
