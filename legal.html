      <h1>Legal Notice &amp; Terms of Use</h1>

      <h4>Platform Objective</h4>
      <p>
        OB1.se is a civic platform centered around a public forum, created to facilitate legal and social reflection based on user contributions. The platform may evolve into additional community tools such as OB1 Circles (e.g., WhatsApp groups, Facebook groups), always centered around the main forum.
      </p>

      <h4>Site Operator</h4>
      <p>
        Owner: Patrice Kenmoé (individual, Sweden-based)<br>
        Email: <a href="mailto:patrice@ob1.se">patrice@ob1.se</a><br>

      <h4>Hosting &amp; Infrastructure</h4>
      <p>
        OB1.se is currently hosted on GitHub Pages. Future hosting will be migrated to Clever Cloud. The discussion platform is being developed using <strong>Flarum</strong>, an open-source forum engine. Depending on deployment and modules, some components may change or expand.
      </p>

      <h4>Participation and Moderation</h4>
      <p>
        This platform does not offer a comment system under blog posts. The forum itself serves as the primary space for open discussion. Users are expected to engage respectfully and lawfully. All content is moderated, and harmful, defamatory, or hostile contributions will be removed.
      </p>

      <h4>Platform Status &amp; Evolution</h4>
      <p>
        OB1 is currently in a rapid development phase. Structural, visual, and editorial changes will occur regularly, possibly several times a day. Visitors should consider the current interface as a prototype version that will evolve quickly.
      </p>

      <h4>Privacy &amp; Analytics</h4>
      <p>
        This site will soon integrate <strong>Matomo</strong> analytics to monitor traffic and engagement anonymously. No cookies or personal identifiers will be stored without explicit consent. Data collection will comply fully with the GDPR.
      </p>

      <h4>Intellectual Property</h4>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise stated, content authored by Patrice Kenmoé is protected by copyright. Contributions by forum participants remain the intellectual property of their authors and are published under open discussion norms.

      <h4>Language Policy</h4>
