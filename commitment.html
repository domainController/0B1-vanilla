          <p>
            This term sheet is initiated by a one-time 600K SEK moral indemnity
            structure and based independently of the 3 operational
            configurations outlined below. If any is choosen, a
            <u>mandatory 1-month onboarding phase</u> is triggered ‚Äî
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">covered by this MIS</mark>
            followed by tailored immersion and reporting sequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any extension or reconfiguration remains entirely at David‚Äôs
            discretion. Legal framing is detailed in the
            <em>Annex for Legal and Financial Structuring</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Base monthly fee</strong>: For both below scenarios, a fixed
            250K SEK/month fee is routed to my independent structure. For the
            incubation scenario, Elite offers direct employment at 80K SEK
            net/month ‚Äî non-negotiable.

            <li>
              <strong>If collaboration is activated</strong>, the agreement
              proceeds under one of the 3 proposed configurations:

            <li>

        <section>
          <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Pre-Mission Setup: Transparency & Installation Logic</h3>

          <p>
            All expenses are recorded in a
            <strong>public-facing logbook</strong> and limited to the first
            month, updated in real time, ensuring <u>clean traceability</u> and
            <u>live transparency</u> throughout the installation process.
          </p>

          <p>
            If further transparency is requested beyond M0, conditions must be
            renegotiated. Full 12-month traceability remains an optional
            extension ‚Äî not included in this sheet.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>üõ°Ô∏è Elite Oversight & Control Rights</h2>
          <p>
            Elite retains full unilateral authority over the operational
            vehicle. It may remove its delegate at any time, without notice or
            justification, and disengage internal accounting support without
            explanation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elite holds veto power over all financial or structural decisions,
            and may trigger company dissolution at will. Monthly reporting is
            generated directly by Elite‚Äôs accounting systems, with tailored
            visibility for executive leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon disengagement, Elite bears no financial, legal, or symbolic
            responsibility.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>üí∞ Operational Scope & Financial Clarity</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Equipment & Technology</strong> (100% self-funded, zero
            Elite cost): Professional hardware (dual 49" monitors ~25,000 SEK),
            software licenses and analytical tools, all computing equipment and
            tech infrastructure. <u>No reimbursement requested from Elite</u> -
            complete personal investment.
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >All equipment remains personal property</mark
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Consulting Services</strong> (shared cost model): Below
            3,500 SEK threshold = <u>100% self-funded</u> (small amounts). Above
            3,500 SEK threshold =
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >50/50 cost sharing with Elite validation</mark

            required, external expert consultations for mission-critical
            intelligence.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Operational Expenses</strong>:
            <u>Fuel reimbursements</u> for mission-related travel including
            extended assignments (dual 49" monitors travel in Volvo for
            Skellefte√• assignments). Small research tools self-funded
            (Crunchbase, databases).
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >Standard Elite accommodation and transport policy</mark
            >.
          </p>

          <h2>üéØ Learning Component & Fresh Perspective</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>First Swedish company</strong>: Direct operational
            experience with local corporate structures while maintaining
            <u>uncompromised analytical perspective</u>. This hands-on learning
            approach ensures deep understanding of Swedish business frameworks
            while preserving the
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >fresh investigative mindset that identified operational blind
              spots</mark
            >
            undetected by established management layers.
          </p>

          <h2>üö™ Post-Mission Transition</h2>

          <p>
            Upon mission completion:
            <strong>Elite delegate removed</strong> from board,
            <u>company renamed</u> to reflect independent activity,
            <strong>new accountant</strong> appointed (Elite accounting ends),
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >full operational independence achieved</mark
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Legal Firewall</strong>: Upon Elite disengagement, all
            Elite-related elements (delegate, accounting, oversight) are
            immediately severed with
            <u>zero ongoing liability or connection</u>.
          </p>

          <h2>üîÑ Alternative Option</h2>

          <p>
            If administrative complexity outweighs benefits: Classic expense
            management via Elite with monthly tech ceiling 8,000 SEK, CFO
            validation for purchases >2,000 SEK,
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >equipment returned at mission end</mark
            >.
          </p>
        </section>

        * Should Elite wish to activate any such recommendation via SPV or asset
        transfer, advisory continuity terms may be discussed

        <h2>üß≥ Operational Setup</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Work Environment</strong><br />
          Preferred setup involves a
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >compact studio (15‚Äì25m¬≤)</mark
          >
          in <u>central Stockholm</u> (√ñstermalm, Vasastan) or
          <u>coastal Malm√∂</u> (Lomma, Limhamn), offering immediate access to
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">stable logistical nodes</mark>
          and <u>team convergence zones</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Mobility</strong><br />
          Operational mobility is ensured via
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >independent vehicle access</mark
          >. No specific model required ‚Äî only reliability, discretion, and
          logistical autonomy.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Infrastructure</strong><br />
          The setup includes <u>dual-screen workstation</u>,
          <u>Mac-based environment</u>, and
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >tech gear designed for fast reporting workflows</mark
          >. All equipment is <strong>pre-installed and self-funded</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Provisioning & Autonomy</strong><br />
          No housing, food, or transport costs are expected from Elite. All
          logistics are <u>managed independently</u> by the operative structure
          to
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >preserve neutrality and reduce integration friction</mark

          <h3>üîÅ Strategic Resonance Layer</h3>

          <p>
            A subset of long-term effects has been observed across similar
            scenarios, typically unplanned but recurrent. These include low-key
            morale drift, reverse mentorship phenomena, and visible value
            realignment in mid-layer teams. While these are not intended, they
            are structurally embedded due to transparency and traceability
            features.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this mission is formally scoped for 12 months, its impact is
            designed to extend beyond direct execution. Presence on site
            triggers a cascade of secondary effects:
            <strong
              >internal audit reflexes, symbolic alignment gestures, moral
              reanchoring</strong
            >, and <u>peer-driven standardization</u>. These effects are seeded
            structurally, not taught.
          </p>

          <p>
            The consultant retains the option to
            <strong>exit every 3 months</strong> without justification, unless
            otherwise engaged in a parallel deployment.
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >David Haldane remains sovereign on all directional
              decisions</mark
            >
            (see Annex IV ‚Äì Prerogative Clause), including early termination,
            scope freezing, or full replication ban.
          </p>

          <p>
            No permanent leadership title is required. However,
            <u>temporary C-suite exposure may be requested</u> (e.g. boardroom
