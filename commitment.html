            This term sheet is initiated by a one-time 600K SEK moral indemnity
            structure and based independently of the 3 operational
            configurations outlined below. If any is choosen, a
            <u>mandatory 1-month onboarding phase</u> is triggered ‚Äî
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">covered by this MIS</mark>
            followed by tailored immersion and reporting sequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any extension or reconfiguration remains entirely at David‚Äôs
            discretion. Legal framing is detailed in the

          <p>
            <strong>Base monthly fee</strong>: For both below scenarios, a fixed
            300K SEK/month fee is routed to my independent structure. For the
            incubation scenario, Elite offers direct employment at 80K SEK
            net/month ‚Äî non-negotiable.

              withdrawal, and triggers blog deactivation.

            <li>
              <strong>If collaboration is activated</strong>, the agreement
              proceeds under one of the 3 proposed configurations:

          <h3>ü§ù Offer Conditions & Engagement Protocol</h3>

          The contract binds three parties:
          <ul>
            <li>
              HILAB (Hospitality Intelligence AB) ‚Äî operational architect and
              sole holder of intellectual property
            </li>
            <li>
              Elite Hotels of Sweden ‚Äî immersive host and employer (for salary
              component)
            </li>
            <li>
              An external fund (to be named) ‚Äî strategic co-financer and
              governance-side partner
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            How the financial contribution is split between Elite and the fund ‚Äî
            and what equity stake it implies ‚Äî is to be determined by them. My
            only condition: the architecture must remain functional,
            non-dilutive, and allow full authorial control over the proprietary
            design.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fund, as principal co-financer, is entitled to a meaningful
            equity position. Without its support, none of this architecture
            could exist.
          </p>

          <p>
            The collaboration framework was intentionally built to allow each
            party to engage at its own level of commitment ‚Äî including the
            option to step back without friction, should governance priorities
            shift. In this structure, Elite Hotels retains the opportunity to
            position itself as the incubator of a sovereign integrity protocol
            now entering public release.
          </p>

          <p>
            All contractual safeguards regarding founder sovereignty,
            traceability, and IP governance are detailed in Annex A9 (Dual
            Integrity Protocol ‚Äì CC BY).

          <p>
            <strong>HILAB (Hospitality Intelligence AB)</strong> ‚Äî Legal company
            structure activated upon contract signature. Elite channels monthly
            fee via this vehicle except CEO salary. Accounting is plugged into
            Elite‚Äôs internal systems and billed monthly. HILAB reimburses the
            cost via compensation deduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            All expenses are recorded in a
            <strong>public-facing logbook</strong> and limited to the first

          <h3>üìÖ Assignment Timeline & Strategic Setup</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>The assignment is structured over 12 months</strong>, in
            three distinct phases:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>M0 onboarding</strong>: solo setup phase (housing,

          <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Pre-Mission Setup: Transparency & Installation Logic</h3>

          <p>
            If further transparency is requested beyond M0, conditions must be
            renegotiated. Full 12-month traceability remains an optional
            extension ‚Äî not included in this sheet.

        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>üõ°Ô∏è Elite Oversight & Control Rights</h2>
          <p>
            Elite retains full unilateral authority over the operational
            vehicle. It may remove its delegate at any time, without notice or
            justification, and disengage internal accounting support without
            explanation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elite holds veto power over all financial or structural decisions,
            and may trigger company dissolution at will. Monthly reporting is
            generated directly by Elite‚Äôs accounting systems, with tailored
            visibility for executive leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon disengagement, Elite bears no financial, legal, or symbolic
            responsibility.

              <u>The only non-negotiable condition</u> is access to a

          <h3>üîÅ Strategic Resonance Layer</h3>

          <p>
            A subset of long-term effects has been observed across similar
            scenarios, typically unplanned but recurrent. These include low-key
            morale drift, reverse mentorship phenomena, and visible value
            realignment in mid-layer teams. While these are not intended, they
            are structurally embedded due to transparency and traceability
            features.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this mission is formally scoped for 12 months, its impact is
            designed to extend beyond direct execution. Presence on site
            triggers a cascade of secondary effects:
            <strong
              >internal audit reflexes, symbolic alignment gestures, moral
              reanchoring</strong
            >, and <u>peer-driven standardization</u>. These effects are seeded
            structurally, not taught.
          </p>

          <p>
            The consultant retains the option to
            <strong>exit every 3 months</strong> without justification, unless
            otherwise engaged in a parallel deployment.
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >David Haldane remains sovereign on all directional
              decisions</mark
            >
            (see Annex IV ‚Äì Prerogative Clause), including early termination,
            scope freezing, or full replication ban.
          </p>

          <p>
            No permanent leadership title is required. However,
            <u>temporary C-suite exposure may be requested</u> (e.g. boardroom
            access, memo validation, discreet strategic attendance) to
            <strong>maximize signal transfer and reduce friction</strong>
            between operational sensing and executive coordination.

        <h2>üö™ Post-Mission Transition</h2>

        <p>
          Upon mission completion:
          <strong>Elite delegate removed</strong> from board,
          <u>company renamed</u> to reflect independent activity,
          <strong>new accountant</strong> appointed (Elite accounting ends),
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >full operational independence achieved</mark
          >.

            The month is also used to
            <strong>absorb sector-specific language</strong> and map the
            regional economy.

          <p>
            Out of respect for internal dynamics, the version circulated among
            upper managers was a significantly toned-down extract. The full
            strategic intent remains with this document only ‚Äî and with the
            decision it invites

        <p class="methodology">
          Current methodology anchors in <em>on-site immersion</em>, with
          deliverables framed as
          <strong>audit by symbolic accorporation</strong>. This approach is
          still being adjusted but already guides early-stage reporting logic.
