            A scalable role will emerge from my operational stance. It will
            encapsulate the audit frame ‚Äî
            <strong>symbolic accorporation</strong> ‚Äî that retroactively shaped
            it. While its core architecture may be released under CC BY, the
            interpretive method remains under proprietary license.
          </p>

          <p>
            Deliverables will bypass traditional reporting: instead, a curated
            sequence of <strong>Pilot Memo¬Æ</strong> and
            <strong>Signal Memo¬Æ</strong> will anchor evidence and
            transferability. Lexical framework and methodological terms will be
            disclosed progressively under license.

          <h3>üè¢ Operational Vehicule</h3>

          <p>
            The board is composed of myself, an in-house lawyer, a senior CTO,
            an ex-Skatteverket profile, a senior hospitality executive, one
            Elite delegate, and one fund-side representative.
          </p>

          <p>
            All operational costs, including legal, infrastructure, travel, and
            field extraction, are handled internally. No further line-item
            budget is required beyond the stated monthly transfer.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>üß¨ Structure Exploration</h3>

          <p>
            The writing process ‚Äî grounded in research constraints, strong
            values, ecosystem logics, the unspoken needs of its actors, and
            active reflection ‚Äî sometimes gives rise to transferable IP. This
            cycle may confirm a previous intuition or produce a new one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Phase 2 formalizes the emerging logic into testable frameworks. The
            goal is to assess structural viability, define key interfaces, and
            evaluate whether the material justifies a spin-off or licensing
            pathway.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase 2 (3 months)</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A 3-month intensive design window to formalize the internal
                  structure of a proprietary diagnostic system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Funded through a <strong>spin-off vehicle</strong>, open to
                  co-financing (GP/Elite)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Must be designed and scoped by <strong>M7</strong>, decision
                  expected by <strong>M8</strong>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <p>
          A spin-off may emerge from this structure, depending on the resonance
          and replicability of the licensed role. No equity discussion is active
          at this stage. Should such a structure materialize, participation from
          Elite or the fund would require a new agreement, under separate terms
          and legal framing.
        </p>
        <section id="engagement-offer">
          <h3>ü§ù Offer Conditions & Engagement Protocol</h3>

          <p>
            The collaboration is structured around three entities: HILAB
            (operational architect and sole IP holder), Elite Hotels (site host
            and employer of record), and a fund-side partner (strategic
            co-financer and governance counterpart).
          </p>

          <p>
            The financial split between Elite and the fund ‚Äî including any
            equity arrangement ‚Äî is left to their internal negotiation. HILAB‚Äôs
            only condition: the architecture must remain non-dilutive and under
            full authorial control.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each party may engage on its own terms, including the option to
            reduce or step back without friction. Elite retains the option to
            position itself as the sovereign incubator of the protocol now
            entering public release.
          </p>

          <p>
            Foundational safeguards regarding authorship, traceability, and
            licensing are defined in Annex A9 (Dual Integrity Protocol ‚Äì CC BY).
          </p>
        </section>

        * Should Elite wish to activate any such recommendation via SPV or asset
        transfer, advisory continuity terms may be discussed

        <p class="methodology">
          Current methodology anchors in <em>on-site immersion</em>, with
          deliverables framed as
          <strong>audit by symbolic accorporation</strong>. This approach is
          still being adjusted but already guides early-stage reporting logic.
