              Before any formal activation, the role enters a

              protocol is triggered. This is a

            Phase 2 formalizes the emerging logic into testable frameworks. The

          A spin-off may emerge from this structure, depending on the resonance
          and replicability of the licensed role. No equity discussion is active
          at this stage. Should such a structure materialize, participation from
          Elite or the fund would require a new agreement, under separate terms
          and legal framing.

            Each party may engage on its own terms, including the option to
